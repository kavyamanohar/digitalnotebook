# Word Embedding

## [Traditional Methods](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/word-embeddings-in-nlp/)

* One-hot Encoding
* BoW
* TFIDF

### Neural Models

#### Static Word Embedding

* Word2Vec
  * CbOW
  * Skipgram
* GloVe
* FastText

#### Dynamic/Contextual Word Embedding

* BERT
* Roberta
* mBERT
* LABASE
*



## Sentence Embeddings

Can be derived from word embeddings, by averaging individual word embeddings.

* Sentence BERT:  approaches like Siamese BERT based models
* MURIL
*
