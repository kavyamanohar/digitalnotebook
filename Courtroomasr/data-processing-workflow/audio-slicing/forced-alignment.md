# Forced Alignment

There are different ways to align the text with audio. I solved it as a text-audio Forced Alignment Problem. &#x20;

#### Forced Alignment with Aeneas

* It is a TTS (espeak) based forced alignment pipeline. But the repo is not in active maintenance. It can give the transcript aligned with time-stamps in srt format of subtitles.
* Ran into multiple issues during local system installation. Installation went well on Google Colab.&#x20;
