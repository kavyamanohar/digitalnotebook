# Audio Slicer

Modernized my [Audio Slicer](https://github.com/kavyamanohar/audioslicer) for this task. This project facilitates easy splitting of audio files into segments based on subtitle information from `.srt` files, generating a ready-to-use audio corpus that can be uploaded to the Hugging Face Hub.

It has the following Dependencies:
