# Text and Audio Curation

### Human Curation

The silence trimmed audios and corresponding text transcripts are compared by manual listening and matching. \

The Hearing of MINERAL AREA DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY ETC. vs. M/S STEEL AUTHORITY OF INDIA  had initial parts of the hearing not recorded. So manually removed the text whose audio was not available.
