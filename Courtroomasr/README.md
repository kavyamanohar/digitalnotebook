# Problem Definition

## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to curate and process a dataset to fine-tune an ASR model, specifically for transcribing Supreme Court hearings.

### Task Overview

1. Build a Data Processing Pipeline
   1. Create a pipeline to process and align the audio and text data.
   2. The pipeline should produce high-quality chunks of data that are aligned and ready for ASR fine-tuning.
2. Output Dataset
   1. Deliver the final dataset in a standard format commonly used for fine-tuning ASR models.
3. Model Fine-tuning
   1. Fine-tune an ASR model of your choice using the prepared dataset.Consider models like Conformer, Parakeet, or Whisper.
